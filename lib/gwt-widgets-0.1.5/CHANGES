==================== GWT Widget Library 0.0.4 ====================

New Packages:

    * org.gwtwidgets.client.temp

This is a package for temporary classes meant to temporarily fix issues 
with GWT components. It is expected that these classes will be removed 
at some point with little warning.

New Classes:

    * JsGraphicsPanel - A wrapper for Walter Zorn's JsGraphics library. 
      Used to lines and shapes, very high browser compatability.

    * Coords - A simple x/y coordinate container, to be extended later.

    * TMouseListenerCollection - Changes the behaviour of the GWT mouse 
      listener collection be changing the X and Y values returned by 
      the events onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onMouseMove. The X and Y 
      coordinates return the position relative to the top-left corner 
      of the panel.

    * TFocusPanel - The same as GWT FocusPanel, except that it uses 
      TMouseListerCollection handling mouse events.

    * ArrayUtils - The start if a collection of new utilities. Initial 
      methods includes toJsArray(double[]), toJsArray(int[]), and 
      toJsArray(Object[]).

    * WindowUtils - The start if a collection of new utilities. Includes 
      the method getLocation(), to get a Location object reflecting the 
      URL of the page. See Location below.

    * Location - Similar to the window.location JavaScript object. 
      Returns individual parts of the URL like getHost() and getPort(). 
      Also parses the query string, allowing access to paremeters by name 
      using getParameter().


Changes:

    * OptionList - Added indexOfValue(String) (thanks to Aaron Watkins)

    * Effect - Added highlight(widget, startColor, endColor, duration)

    * PNGImageImpl - New PNGImage will now set the width and height of 
      the image tag. This allows for the use of spacers and such, where 
      you need to stretch the image to a specific size.

    * WBuilder - replaceElement() fixed. Caused problems when replacing 
      a widget with another widget that wasn't already attached to the 
      RootPanel.

    * WPanel - Changed WIDGET_TYPE value from the erroneous "hyperlink' 
      to "panel".
    

==================== GWT Widget Library 0.0.3 ====================

    * Major package reorganization

    * WHyperlink - Added getHref()

    * New Classes
          o WTextBox (John Menke)
          o OptionList (Jack Tang)
          o FormPanel
          o FileUploadField
          o SearchUtils
          

==================== GWT Widget Library 0.0.2 ====================

   * Wrap existing HTML elements as widgets. Support for hyperlinks, 
     images, buttons, and panels.

   * Replace existing elements and widgets on the page with other widgets.

   * PNGImage widget, with support for transparancy in IE5.5 and IE6.

   * Color and BorderStyle constants for setting styles. Currently
     used in the new ImageButton widget.

   * ImageButton widget designed for use in tool bars. Allows for 
     creation of buttons individually, or with the help of the 
     ImageButtonFactory.


==================== GWT Widget Library 0.0.1 ====================

   * Scriptaculous Effect Wrapper
