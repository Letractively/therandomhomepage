    <h3>What's this site ?</h3>

    <p>
        <b>TheRandomHomepage.com</b> was not intended to be <b>Y</b>et <b>A</b>nother <a class="helpLink"
                                                                                         title="Web 2.0" target="_new"
                                                                                         href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"><b>W</b>eb
        2.0</a> <b>P</b>ersonalized <b>H</b>omepage. The idea of this website evolved from the fact that everything has
        its
        purpose, so as "<b><a target="_new" class="helpLink" title="Randomness"
                              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness">randomness</a></b>". Think about flipping
        through books in bookstore, changing radio station in
        car stereo, finding an interesting Ad in classifieds section, you might bump into something new, fresh and
        interesting.

        As the point #7 in Google's corporate philosophy points out, "<I><a title="More Information" class="helpLink"
                                                                            target="_new"
                                                                            href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">There's
        always more information out there</a></I>".
        The planet internet has lots to offer and tons to discover.

        We would like to quote "<I><a title="World Wide Web"
                                      class="helpLink" target="_new"
                                      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World
