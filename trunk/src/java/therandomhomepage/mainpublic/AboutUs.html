<h3>What's this site ?</h3>
<p>

The idea of this site evolved from the fact that everything has its purpose, so as "<b>randomness</b>". Think about flipping through books in bookstores, changing radio stations in car stereo, finding an interesting ad on classifieds, you might bump into something new, interesting or exciting. It's highly effective to pick a random item from large array of collection than to do it in an orderly way. Internet has lots of things of offer.
